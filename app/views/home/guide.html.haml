%h1 Instructor Guides

<p>
These guides will help instructors to set up an OpenDSA eTextbook
instance for use within a Canvas course, and/or add individual exercises
and visualizations to their Canvas, Moodle, or Blackboard course.
If your institution has its own Canvas installation, then you can
attach an OpenDSA eTextbook to any course where you have instructor
permissions.
If you don't have access to Canvas at your institution, then you can
create a Canvas course at the public Canvas site,
<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com">https://canvas.instructure.com</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you are an OpenDSA developer, then you probably want
to set up your own test installation following the directions at
<a href="https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA-DevStack">
https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA-DevStack</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 2:</b> Instructors should <b>not</b> use the Canvas "clone
course" feature as a way to copy an existing course with OpenDSA
materials.
The process described here for creating a course with an OpenDSA
textbook sets up course-specific links that cannot be cloned.
If you want to clone the course for reasons other than to duplicate
the OpenDSA textbook, you can still do that.
Just delete all of the OpenDSA modules and Assignments, and then use
the directions here to create the new eTextbook materials in the new
course shell.
